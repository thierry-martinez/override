# override 0.1.0, 2019-05-09

- generalizes ppx_import by allowing a whole module to be imported
  with all its types, possibly with annotations.

- module overriding: mechanization of Gabriel Scherer's post on Gagallium blog
  http://gallium.inria.fr/blog/overriding-submodules/

- type rewriting: types can be systematically annotated, substituted,
  renamed, or removed. Transformations such as those that are described in
  the comments of ast/ast.ml in ppxlib sources can be mechanized.
